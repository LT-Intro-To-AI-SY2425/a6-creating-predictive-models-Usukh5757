# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
# r square value signifies the best fit line for the data. The value of 0.626 means that the line isn't a good fit and that may be due to unknown factors.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
# 137
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
# Since we have very limited data, it is impossible for the model to be accurate. This number is, at best, an estimate.
